## Descripción del problema:

In poker, people make decisions involving complex mathematical calculations. Even for the profesional players retaining all that information can be a challenge. As if this were not enough, they have a deadline to make decisions, so it is often necessary to sacrifice accuracy for speed.

## Solución propuesta:

This project aims to create a web application that will help people make decisions

The application will consist of a graphical interface where a map of possible hands will be displayed, showing by means of a color code the probability of winning with the current hand and the bet placed.

The player may define the conditions of the game (hand,bet,opponents,etc.) and the application will guide the player to the best play according to the optimal game theory (OGT).

The followings imagenes simplify the main idea:
